## Introduction

Welcome to this algorithm training project focused on a common technical interview question: checking if a singly linked list is a palindrome. üéâ This challenge tests your understanding of linked lists, data structure manipulation, and algorithm optimization in the C programming language. üöÄ Let's dive into the problem statement, requirements, and the approach to tackle this intriguing problem without the help of external resources.

## Technical Interview Preparation

- **No Googling**: You are not allowed to google anything. This constraint aims to simulate a real technical interview environment where you rely solely on your knowledge and problem-solving skills.
  
- **Whiteboard First**: Before jumping into coding, start with whiteboarding. Sketch out your approach, data structures, and the algorithm flow to organize your thoughts and solutions.

## Project Description

Your task is to write a function in C that checks whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. This concept, when applied to linked lists, implies that the list's values form a palindrome sequence.

## Function Prototype

```c
int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
```

- **Parameters**: A pointer to the head of the singly linked list.
- **Return Value**: The function should return `0` if the list is not a palindrome and `1` if it is a palindrome.
- **Empty List Consideration**: An empty list is considered a palindrome and should therefore return `1`.

## Expected Outcome

- Implement the function with an efficient algorithm that minimizes time and space complexity.
- Consider edge cases, such as single-node lists and lists with an even/odd number of nodes.
- Ensure that the original linked list structure remains unchanged after the function executes.

## Conclusion

This project offers a fantastic opportunity to hone your algorithm and data structure skills, crucial for technical interviews and competitive programming. üèÜüí° By working through the problem without external aids, you develop a deeper understanding of linked lists and algorithmic problem-solving techniques that are valuable in a wide range of software development contexts.

Happy coding, and may you successfully demonstrate that a linked list is (or isn't) a palindrome with elegance and efficiency!
