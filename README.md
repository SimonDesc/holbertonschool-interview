### Heap Insert 🌲

Dive into binary trees and heap data structures by implementing a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap.

### Insert in Sorted Linked List 🔗

Master linked lists by creating a function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### Linked List Palindrome 🔄

Challenge your understanding of linked lists and palindromes by writing a function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

### Lockboxes 🗝️

Solve a unique problem that tests your ability to work with arrays and unlocking mechanisms.

### Minimum Operations ✂️

Develop an algorithm to determine the minimum operations needed to achieve a specific goal, enhancing your problem-solving skills.

### Sandpiles 🏖️

Explore the concept of Abelian sandpiles and implement a function to stabilize sandpiles, a fascinating computational problem.

### Log Parsing 📜
Analyze and process log files efficiently with a function designed to parse and summarize key information.

### Palindrome Integer 🔢
Devise a method to determine if a given integer is a palindrome, testing your skills in numerical algorithms.
